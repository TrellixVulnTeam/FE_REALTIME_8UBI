        <h4 style="text-align:center">Provider Claim Dispute Resolution Mechanism<br>
          (Provider Claims Appeal Process)</h4>
        <p>A provider claim dispute is a written notice to CHCN challenging, appealing or requesting
          reconsideration of a claim (or a bundled group of substantially similar multiple claims that are
          individually numbered) that has been denied, adjusted or contested or seeking resolution of a
          billing determination, or disputing a request for reimbursement of an overpayment of a claim.
          <br><br>If a provider wants to dispute a claim payment or denial (for reasons not related to provider’s
          claim submission error or omission) the provider can submit a written dispute to the following
          address:</p>
          <p style="text-align:center">Community Health Center Network
            <br>Attn: Provider Claims Dispute Department
            <br>101 Callan Avenue, Suite 300
            <br>San Leandro, CA 94577
            <br>510-297-0210
          </p>
          <p>Note: Claims that are denied due to provider’s claim submission error or omission (e.g.
            missing/incorrect CPT, ICD-10-CM or place of service codes) or any changes in the claim form
            made from original submission do not qualify for the Provider Claim Dispute Resolution
            Mechanism. Claims resubmission with medical records for review due to bundling edits,
            included services, request for medical records/treatment notes, anesthesia time spent or EOB
            submissions should be sent directly to claims dept. not through provider disputes. These should
            be resubmitted within the time period for claim submission as “Corrected Claim” with a brief
            explanation either noted on the claim or as an attachment.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The provider must submit a Notice of Provider Claim Dispute (NOPD) in writing along
                with any relevant and supporting documentation within 365 days of CHCN’s last action
                or, in the case of inaction, 365 days after the Time for Contesting or Denying Claims has
                expired.</li>
              <br>
              <li>The Provider Claim Dispute must include:
                  <ol>
                      <li type="a">Provider’s Name</li>
                      <li type="a">Provider’s ID Number</li>
                      <li type="a">Provider’s Contact Information (Name, Address, Phone Number)</li>
                      <li type="a">Patient’s Name</li>
                      <li type="a">Patient’s DOB</li>
                      <li type="a">Claim Number (from CHCN remittance advice)</li>

                      <li type="a">Other pertinent documentation to support appeal</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>CHCN will acknowledge the receipt of the written claim dispute within fifteen (15)
                working days of receipt of the dispute.</li>
              <br>
              <li>If CHCN receives an incomplete provider claim dispute, CHCN will return it to the
                provider with a clear identification of the missing information.</li>
              <br>
              <li>The provider has thirty (30) working days from the receipt of the returned NOPD to
                resubmit an Amended Claim Dispute with the requested information.</li>
              <br>
              <li>CHCN will issue a written determination, including a statement of the pertinent facts and
                reasons, to the provider within forty-five (45) working days after receipt of the provider
                claim dispute or the amended provider claim dispute.</li>
